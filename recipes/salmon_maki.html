    <p>Hosomaki literally translates as “skinny roll” and usually only comes with 1-2 ingredients. 
        This is considered to be one of the most traditional styles of sushi maki (rolls).</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of Seasoned Sushi Rice</li>
        <li>Makisu (wrapped in cellophane, preferably)</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. of Wild Alaskan King Salmon</li>
        <li>5 Half-sheets of Nori</li>
        <li>Bowl of Water</li>
        <li>A Sharp Knife (like a Yanagiba)</li>
        <li>A Cutting Board</li>
        <li>Hand Towel</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Once your sushi rice is cooked, seasoned, and cooled, 
            place a small handful of rice on the rough side of your nori.
            Make sure to leave at least 2cm of nori bare at the top of the roll.</li>
        <li>Using four fingers on both hands, gently press the rice along the 
            center to create a “valley.”</li>
        <li>Slice rectangular pieces of salmon for your roll. I made a 
            1 cm thick slice and then sliced that in half:</li>
        <li>Place the slices onto your rice along the “valley” you created in step 2</li>
        <li>This is the trickiest part. You need to dip your fingers in your water and 
            transfer the water to the top portion of the nori. This will make the nori 
            soggy and it will quickly start to curl. Before the nori starts to curl, you need to roll the salmon roll up 
            until the smooth side of the nori meets the wet portion. 
            This will make it so that the nori sticks to itself and gives 
            clean-looking results.</li>
        <li>Now that our salmon roll is all put together, it's time to cut. 
            Slice the roll in half, 
            and then put the two halves together and slice them into thirds</li>
        <li>Turn the end pieces up, so that we can see that pretty salmon and then 
            transfer it to a plate.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>ENJOY!</h3>
