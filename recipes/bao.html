    <p>In Canton, China where dim sum originated, it's considered one of the “Four Heavenly Kings of Dim Sum (早茶四大天王)” that you must order at a Yum Cha restaurant</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h3>The Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350g Bao Flour/Cake Flour, or All-Purpose Flour
            <p>To achieve an extra fluffy texture that Char Siu Bao is famous for, 
                it's best to use low gluten flour, such as cake flour or special bao flour 
                (available in Chinese stores) which has 7-8g protein per 100g flour. 
                If unavailable, you may use all-purpose flour which has 10-11g protein. 
                In this case, you'll need to increase the water volume to 190ml.</p></li>
        <li>2 teaspoon Instant Dry Yeast
            <p>Instant dry yeast can be mixed directly with flour. If using active dry 
                yeast which are larger granules, dissolve it in water first 
                then mix with other ingredients.</p></li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon Sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1½ Tablespoon Neutral Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>180 g lukewarm water, adjust if necessary. The dough should be soft but not sticky.</li>

    <h3>The Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ Onion,Sliced</li>
        <li>120g Water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dark Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>½ Tablespoon Neutral Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Char Siu Sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon Oyster Sauce </li>
        <li>2 Tablespoon Tapioca Starch (or Corn Starch), Mix with 3 Tablespoon Water</li>
        <li>130 g Char Siu (Chinese BBQ pork)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil to a pan. Fry onion until slightly golden.</li>
        <li>Pour in water. Then add oyster sauce, Char Siu sauce and dark soy sauce. 
            Leave it to boil for 30 seconds. Use a slotted spoon to remove the onion.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to the lowest. Mix the starch water very well then pour in. 
            Stir constantly until the liquid turns into jelly. Transfer to a bowl to cool.</li>
        <li>Coarsely chop Char Siu into small pieces. Add to the jelly. Mix well and set aside.</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Making the Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>IF USING HANDS:</strong> Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, yeast and oil in a bowl. 
            Add water gradually while mixing with a pair of chopsticks/spatula. 
            Combine with your hands to form a dough. 
            Rest (covered ) for 10 mins then knead again until very smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>IF USING A STAND MIXER:</strong> Add all the ingredients for the dough into the mixing bowl. 
            Knead on low speed for about 8 mins until a smooth dough forms.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rolling the Wrappers</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the dough into 14 equal parts. Work on one piece at a time and make 
            sure you cover the rest to prevent it from drying out.</li>
        <li>With a rolling pin, flatten one piece into a disc-like wrapper, 9-10cm in diameter. 
            Ideally, it should be thinner on the edge & thicker in the middle</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Shaping the Bao</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Place a spoonful of filling (about 20g) in the middle of the wrapper. Then follow the pictures on how to fold the wrapper.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Rest the Bao</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Repeat to finish all the wrappers and filling. Then place the bao into steamer baskets lined with parchment paper to prevent 
            sticking (Alternatively, brush a thin layer of oil if using a metal/plastic steamer).</li>
        <li>Leave to rest for 30 minutes or so until they become very light & plump (no need to cover).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steam the Bao</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bring water to a full boil in a wok/pot. Place the steamer baskets in. Steam over medium-high heat for 10 mins. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>ENJOY!</h3>

        <p><h3>Store and Reheat</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You can make extra filling for later use and store it in the freezer for up to three months.</li>
                <li>It's not recommended to store uncooked bao. 
                    Instead, cooked bao freeze very well. Consume within three months.</li>
                <li><strong>To reheat:</strong> Defrost in the fridge then steam for 3 mins. Alternatively, steam for 6 mins without defrosting.</li>
            </ul>
